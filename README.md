# Plotly Deployment

Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js.

In theory, the ideal bacteria species to make synthetic beef may be found in the belly button. To test the hypothesis, we have samples of the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species that colonize their belly buttons. Each person's identity is anonymous. Instead, ID numbers were assigned. Using JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, we built an interactive dashboard where researchers and participants can easily access information about the participant's belly button bacterial species.

When an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu:

- The Demographic Information panel shows ethnicity, gender, age, location, blood type, and individual's weekly washing frequency.

- The Horizontal Bar Chart displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs).

- The Gauge Chart displays the weekly washing frequency's value as a measure from 0-10.

- The Bubble Chart displays all bacteria cultures found in an individual's belly button.
